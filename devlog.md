So, The battle engine is being.... harder than I expected.
I may need to write a new engine instead of using the old one.
Certain pieces just don't fit in... I also need to work on the town and shops.

Everything is up on github now! I finally set up git on my localhost. 
I've been pretty lazy on this project, more info will be uploaded soon.

Save and Load script are done. I decided that having the two
functions in separate files was a good idea. Easier to trace an error.
I don't really care about the number of imports. It's written to save
just the Player stats, but I mean nobody will need to save before that
comes around anyways.

Battle engine started working, I realized that the error was that no
enemy was defined lol. I'm getting pissed off with python's
tabbing system though. It's very buggy in my opinion, 70% of my
errors is just Vim being confused if it is 4 spaces or a tab. Why
can't it just use curly brackets like other languages? Whatever,
I shouldn't rant here. Name feature for the player was added too.

I think the battle engine is done! Not sure if it should randomly
select the monster in the battle engine or the field. (which I need to
start) Next up, the town.

I've been working harder on this project recently. I've been
pretty distracted with this for the past few months,(It's an
independent study, this is just for the end of year project)
my schedule has me working for only 100 min a day (Tuesday and Thursday.)
But on the status, minor changes all around and a good bit of the base
program finished. The town looks like a lot of work though, but it
will be done soon enough. I'm estimating this will be done in
February? Depends on how much more I add.

Well, I think this will have a "beta launch" in a few days! (if you
want to call it that, lol) Once the town if finished the game should
run just fine, but there is more content and polish that needs to be
added.
