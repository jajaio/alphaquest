so, the battle will be based in this order.

1. Check to see if health is below zero.
2. Person with the highest agility attacks first.
3. The amount of dmg done to hp + defence.
4. Person with the lower AGI will attack
5. The amount of dmg done to hp + defence.

example code:

while True:
  if cl.Player.hp < 1:
    #death
  elif cl.Foe.hp < 1:
    #victory
  else:
    #battle stats on screen
    if cl.Player.agi >= cl.Monster.agi:
      #player attacks
      cl.Monster.hp -= cl.Player.att
      cl.Monster.hp += cl.Monster.deff
      #monster attacks
      cl.Player.hp -= cl.Monster.att
      cl.Player.hp += cl.Player.deff
    elif cl.Monster.agi >= cl.Monster.agi:
      #monster attacks
      #player attacks
